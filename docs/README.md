# Detailed Documentation

[Rabi-Ribi Map Editing Main Page](https://wcko87.github.io/rabiribi-map-editing/)

This is the detailed documentation for some of the more technical aspects of map editing (especially events). It's a little messy around here.

Basically we store id tables miscellaneous notes around here. Click around the various files in this directory to look through them.

## Event Basics:

How to use events
* Suppose you want to place a certain type of event (e.g. a heal point)
* First, remember the location of a known heal point (e.g. the big flower near aruraune)
* Then open up the corresponding map and go to that location and note down the event id.
* Place that event id in the map to get a heal point.

## Item Basics:

The [table of item ids](./items/item_ids.csv) can be found in the detailed docs.
