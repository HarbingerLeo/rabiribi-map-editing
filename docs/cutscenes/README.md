# Custom Cutscenes

**Note: This only works in the Rabi-Ribi v1.8e**

In-game events start cutscenes. Cutscenes each have their own cutscene ID.
The cutscene IDs can be seen above the block of text representing the cutscene.
To find out which cutscene is triggered by an event, refer to the file `Rabi-Ribi\localize\event\story_en.rbrb`. (Open it in a text editor)

The files `story_emot.rbrb` and `story_text.rbrb` can be placed together with your maps to replace the original in-game cutscenes/dialogue.

* [`story_text.rbrb`](story_text.md) contains the dialogue text used in the cutscene
* [`story_emot.rbrb`](story_emot.md) contains other cutscene information like characters / emotions etc.
