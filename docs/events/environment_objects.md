# Environment Objects

Events in the range 5500-5575 spawn environment objects.
- 5500 is a palm tree
- 5575 is a bush

Note: All events from 5575 and up spawn a bush. (e.g. event id 30000 spawns a bush)

Be mindful that these environment objects may interfere with event modifiers (id 5000+ events are used as event modifiers)

[A proper list of environment objects will be made at some point]
